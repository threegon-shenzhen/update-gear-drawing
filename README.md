Hi Jerry 
 
hope you have good days !
we are improveing the precision of the gear internally.
about the the previous dimension 7.0mm+/-0.2mm. as we knew we hope can control it  more accurate to close 7.00+/-0.05mm.
after we had asked many gear samples from many suppliers ,and we have measured this position ,most of them are controled in 7.0+/-0.2mm.
but one of them are able to control it to be 7.0+/-0.10mmï¼Œthis is the most accurate among them.  so we think the supplier can be our gear supplier .
 
we have updated the 2D drawing attached, I will update it on GitHub later if you confirmed the tolerance is acceptable.

Maurice
